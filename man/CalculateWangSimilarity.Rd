\title{Calculate pairwise Wang semantic similarity between a group of genes}
\usage{
CalculateWangSimilarity(
  OrgDb,
  keytype = "ENTREZID",
  ont = "BP",
  genes = NULL,
  dropCodes = NULL,
  minIC = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{OrgDb}{OrgDb object}

\item{keytype}{keytype to select records from OrgDb. All possible keys are returned by using the keys method.}

\item{ont}{Type of ontology to be used. One of 'BP', 'MF', 'CC'. Defaults to BP.}

\item{genes}{List of genes for which to calculate pairwise Wang semantic similarity between them. Defaults to NULL (use all annotated genes)}

\item{dropCodes}{List of codes of annotation evidence types. Annotations with this codes will be dropped before calculating similiarity. Defaults to NULL, including all annotations.}

\item{minIC}{Minimum term information content 'IC' to take into account. Terms with less IC won't be used for calculations. Defaults to NULL}
}
\value{
A matrix of pairwise gene similarities
}
